# **Fake album data generator for JSON Server**
💻 Generate random data for JSON Server, along with fake album covers sourced from Reddit.

This repository contains the `index.js` script for generating fake data for [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), as well as cover images for fake albums, sourced from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fakealbumcovers/). Should only be used in development purpose.

## How it Works
1. Install json-server.
2. Copy the images from the `covers` folder to your CDN or locally.
3. Modify the `index.js` file to specify your `path/to/images`. Also, feel free to change the data structure as you wish, the [Faker](https://github.com/faker-js/faker) module is used here.
4. Copy the `index.js` and `albums.json` files to where you have deployed the json-server, then run the command `json-server index.js` ✅
